# 📚 ScoreSaver: ACT & SAT Study Hub for High School Students

ScoreSaver is a centralized, easy-to-navigate web hub created to help high school students prepare for the ACT and SAT. It gathers essential test prep materials, including strategy guides, curated notes, important links, and free resources—all in one place. The goal is to simplify studying and support students, especially those who don’t have access to expensive prep tools or tutoring.

## 🎯 Purpose
As a high school student, I realized how overwhelming and scattered ACT and SAT prep could be. There were plenty of resources online, but no single place that brought everything together clearly. So I built ScoreSaver to fix that is a  study-friendly space where students could find everything they need to prepare efficiently and confidently.
