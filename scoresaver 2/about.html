                <p>
                    Welcome to the ScoreSaver!
My name is Meet Patel, and I’m an 18-year-old student who attended Fern Creek High School in Louisville, Kentucky.

I originally created this platform while I was still in high school, with one goal in mind: to help other students succeed on the SAT and ACT. I wanted to provide clear, helpful resources and guidance that I wish I had during my own exam prep journey.

This project was born out of the Congressional App Challenge, a national competition that allows high school students to develop apps and websites using any programming language. It’s a valuable opportunity for young creators interested in pursuing careers in computer science — and it gave me the chance to build something with lasting impact.

Rather than making a one-time-use app, I aimed to create a resource students could return to whenever they needed it — especially high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors preparing for college entrance exams.

I hope this website makes your SAT/ACT prep a little less stressful and a lot more effective. Thanks for visiting, and best of luck on your exams!
