                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi! My name is Meet Patel, and I’m an 18-year-old Computer Science freshman at the University of Louisville.

                    I first created ScoreSaver back when I was a student at Fern Creek High School in Louisville, Kentucky. My goal was simple: to help other students prepare for the SAT and ACT with the kind of clear and useful resources I wish I had when I was studying.
                    
                    This project started as part of the Congressional App Challenge, a national competition where students build apps or websites to solve real problems. It gave me the opportunity to combine my love for coding with something meaningful that could actually help others.
                    
                    Instead of making a one time app, I wanted to build something students could always come back to, whether they’re just starting SAT prep or reviewing before test day.
                    
                    I hope ScoreSaver makes your exam prep a little easier and more organized. Thanks for stopping by, and good luck on your SAT and ACT journey!
